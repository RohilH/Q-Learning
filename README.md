# Q-Learning
Implemented a Q-learning algorithm to learn the game snake
Code can be run by running python snake_main.py
Two algorithms are included, simply comment out the existing code in the act function (inside agent.py) and uncomment the code underneath.
The first algorithm implements Temporal Difference Q-Learning, while the second algorithm uses SARSA Q-Learning.
